## Datafiles

The [`demos/watercolors.json`](demos/watercolors.json) datafile comes from
https://github.com/thisisparker/datasets and had one record manually adjusted
(see: https://github.com/thisisparker/datasets/pull/1).

The [`demos/thumbs.json`](demos/thumbs.json) was generated by a modified
`pomfetch.py` from https://github.com/thisisparker/pomtiles (see:
https://github.com/thisisparker/pomtiles/pull/2). The demos during my talk
took advantage of locally-cached images to avoid any possible WiFi issues. The
Rmds in this directory have been updated to use wikimedia URLs instead.
