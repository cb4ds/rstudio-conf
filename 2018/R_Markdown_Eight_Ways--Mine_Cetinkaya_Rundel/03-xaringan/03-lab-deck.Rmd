<!-- Add agenda, some words about visualization, and some for git -->

## Agenda

1. **An example of the power of visualization:** 
2. **Git wisdom**
3. **Lab intro**
4. **Starting a new project** and next steps

---

## What do these guys have in common?

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="300px", out.height="250px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/03-viz-sp-data/John_Snow.jpg"); knitr::include_graphics("img/03-viz-sp-data/John_Snow-got.jpg")
```

---

## The power of visualization

They're both named John Snow, but only one of them was involved with the 1854 Broad Street London cholera outbreak.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="500px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/03-viz-sp-data/Snow-cholera-map.jpg")
```

---

## Git wisdom

- Git commands should be used with intent

- During lab, try to avoid this: "I'm confused; let's see if clicking this fixes anything" (ask me, or talk with teammates)

- When not in lab, (careful) experimentation is totally encouraged!

- Bottom line: understand *why* a command does what it does.

<!-- INFO FROM LAB -->

## Lab intro

Have you ever taken a road trip in the US and thought to yourself "I wonder what La Quinta means". Well, the late comedian [Mitch Hedberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Hedberg) thinks it's Spanish for *next to Denny's*.

## Starting a new project

- Go to the course organization on GitHub: https://github.com/Sta199-S18.

- Find the repo starting with `lab-03` and that has your team name at the end (this should be the only `lab-03` repo available to you).

- In the repo, click on the green **Clone or download** button, select **Use HTTPS** (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, you'll see the text **Clone with HTTPS** as in the image below). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.

- Go to RStudio Cloud and into the course workspace. Create a **New Project from Git Repo**. You will need to click on the down arrow next to the **New Project** button to see this option.

- Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box:

- Hit OK, and you're good to go!

---

## Packages

In this lab we will work with the `tidyverse` package. So we need to 
install and load it:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse) 
```

Note that this package is also loaded in your R Markdown document.

---

## Git configuration

- Go to the *Terminal* pane
- Type the following two lines of code, replacing the information in the quotation marks with your info.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git config --global user.email "your email"
git config --global user.name "your name"
```

To confirm that the changes have been implemented, run the following:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git config --global user.email
git config --global user.name
```
